# Breastfeeding Awareness Week 2025

A cinematic approach to public health. Commissioned by the **Ministry of Health**, we produced the official spot for the National Breastfeeding Week (Nov 1-7).

## The Objective
To shift the narrative from "medical advice" to "emotional bond." The campaign highlights the health benefits for both mother and child:
*   **Immunity:** Natural protection against allergies.
*   **Health:** Reducing postpartum risks for mothers.

## Production Note
Shot on location with a focus on natural light to symbolize the natural bond.
