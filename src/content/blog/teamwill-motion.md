# Finance Meets AI

**Teamwill** has 20 years of experience in credit and leasing. For their "Vision 2030" roadmap, they needed a visual language that spoke to the future.

## The Challenge
How do you visualize "Operational Excellence" and "Sustainable Finance"? 

## The Solution
We used abstract 3D Motion Design to represent their core pillars:
1.  **Digitalization:** Fluid data streams.
2.  **AI:** Neural network visualizations.
3.  **Growth:** Upward kinetic movement.

"Anticipate and change" is their motto. We made sure their video moved just as fast.
